Offline Games App Implementation Plan
Goal Description
Build a cross-platform mobile application (iOS & Android) containing a collection of classic offline games. The app will be built using React Native (Expo) to ensure native performance, easy offline support, and straightforward ad integration.

Proposed Tech Stack
Framework: React Native (Expo)
Language: TypeScript
Navigation: React Navigation (Native Stack)
State Management: React Context / Hooks (sufficient for simple games)
Persistence: AsyncStorage (for high scores and saved states)
Ads: Expo Ads AdMob (or similar compatible library)
Architecture
Screens:
HomeScreen: Displays a grid of available games.
GameScreen: A generic wrapper that loads a specific game component based on route parameters.
SettingsScreen: Toggle sound, manage data.
Game Components:
Each game will be a self-contained component in src/games/[GameName].
Common utils in src/utils (e.g., game loop hooks, collision detection).
Level System:
LevelGenerator: Utility to procedurally generate levels for games like Maze and Water Sort to ensure infinite/100+ variants.
LevelSelector: UI component for choosing levels.
Initial Games (Phase 1)
Tic Tac Toe: Simple logic to validate state management.
Snake: Requires a game loop and simple graphics.
2048: Grid logic and animations.
Level-Based Games (Phase 2 & 3)
For games where levels are appropriate, we will implement a minimum of 100 levels, primarily using procedural generation to ensure scalability and replayability.

Maze:
Algorithm: Recursive Backtracker or Prim's Algorithm.
Difficulty: Increasing grid size (e.g., Level 1: 5x5 -> Level 100: 30x30).
Water Sorting:
Algorithm: Random shuffle with solvability check.
Difficulty: Increasing number of tubes and colors.
Snake:
Levels: Different map layouts / obstacle configurations.
Verification Plan
Automated Tests:
Unit tests for game logic (e.g., win conditions for Tic Tac Toe).
Manual Verification:
Run npx expo start and test on Android Emulator / iOS Simulator.
Verify offline mode by toggling network off.
